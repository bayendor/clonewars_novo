			<h2>Learn about our process</h2>
			<p><p>Coffee is commonplace, yet a truly great cup reveals a complex process. We roast coffees early in the week in our vintage Vittoria machines (fun fact: one of them is powered by a Ferrari motor). We deliver the coffees to some of Colorado&#8217;s finest independent restaurants, coffee shops, and natural grocers promptly after roasting. We believe coffee is more than a commodity, and we are always striving for constant improvement in search of a delicious cup. While we take coffee seriously, we firmly believe in not taking ourselves too seriously, as evidenced by impromptu ping pong tournaments, plasma cars, and a fridge full of local microbrews.</p>
