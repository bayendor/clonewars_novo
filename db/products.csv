El Banco	Central America	regular	We’re sorry, this product is unavailable. Novo’s El Banco comes from our friend Luis Araujo’s farm in eastern El Salvador. Why the piggy bank, you ask? The El Banco coffee trees, found on a tiny plot of land at 1,450 meters,  are the original source or “seed bank” of the pacamara varietal. This varietal is now commonly found throughout Central and South America. Unfortunately, due to the devastating coffee leaf rust, the 2013 El Banco coffee crop from the Araujo farm was destroyed and we aren’t able to offer it this year.	16	ca-el_banco.png	[12oz 2lb 5lb]
Mundani	Central America	regular	We’re sorry, this product is unavailable. Down the hill from the tiny El Banco plot on Luis Araujo’s farm lies another small lot of pacamara coffee trees (a hybrid of the giant-bean maragogipe and pacas). This lot, found on Luis’s farm in eastern El Salvador, lies at 1,400 meters and  is dominated by Mundani shade trees. Unfortunately, due to coffee leaf rust, the 2013 crop of Mundani coffee has been destroyed.	14.50	ca_mundani.png	[12oz 2lb 5lb]
